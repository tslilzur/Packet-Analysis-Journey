Force for example, this is how I made the ChatGPT prompt to teach me to prepare for the copmTIA 701 exam, I will take PDF files from known resources that help prepare for the exam. I will paste the question in ChatGPT right after he will let me know :
what is the right answer right?
Why the wrong answers are wrong?
He will give me a real life example of the use 
He will try to give me like a memory hook that can be helpful in the exam
I also ask him to try reverse the question - so he will ask me something different. What is the same logic to try and make me think?
And finally, he will try to teach me if for example a new term is coming up. It will be helpful to try to read about it and try to understand and then I will take notes.

So this is how I've been preparing for the exam and hopefully I will pass

✅ Correct Answer: C. Steganography

⸻

🧠 Why it’s correct:
• Steganography embeds hidden data inside files like images or audio.
• The carrier file looks normal but contains concealed content.
• Large file size is often a giveaway.

❌ Why the others are wrong:
• A. Encryption hides content — not within other files.
• B. Watermarking is for ownership — not secrecy.
• D. Hashing validates integrity — doesn’t hide content.

🌍 Real-World Tie-In:
Malware and espionage campaigns sometimes use steganography to sneak payloads past filters.

🧠 Memory Hook:
“Stego = stealthy pixels.”

🔁 Reverse Question:
What technique hides secret data inside an image or audio file?
💡 Answer: Steganography

📘 Teach Me:
Steganography differs from encryption: it hides the existence of the data, not just its content.
