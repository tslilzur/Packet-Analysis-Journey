around march 2025 ive started to learn cyber sacuriy on cursera google soc for a around a month and then drop it after getting the basic knowledge like CIA triad and what a soc analsys do 
ive completed 5 modeules and moved to TryHackMe, the reson for that is because iv been looking for a why to get on hand parctis with tools and the understanding with more organised pathway 
tryhackme have done it well giving the new student a clear like pathway to follow step by step, after moving to try Hockney website I've been looking to get my hands on some sort of certification that will have some sort of validation of my knowledge and how I've been self starting a self learning I came across multiple recommendation of their coptia+ 701 security+ exam and started to learn the modules that are included in the exam
For materials I used - professor Messer videos on YouTube + mark exams and questions combined with ChatGPT to tutor me through the process. I will attach a screenshot.

I mean, aiming to take the exam this month( may ) to have my first step into the industry 

I've started this github profile as it was suggested in multiple places that I will record my progress through my learning because it will be a easy tool to share with later on employers to see how how I take notes and how do I make how did I do stuff on my own and learned on my own so I am starting to do it in obviously to look like quite a mess but hopefully I will get a hand of it later as I do it.

so far ive been taking notes on my notbook - and from today on 16-may-2025 im going to record my notes problems and progress here (I'm going to upload my notebook notes here too) 

So I can summarise my I would say journey but it's more like the beginning of the decision to to learn cyber security. I've been focusing on two main things. One is the certification and the other is on hand experience with labs and progressive learning through try hack me websit, at the beginning of course everything looked different and didn't make any sense. A lot of words that I didn't understand what the meaning of them slowly getting the hand of what's going on and how to think to try to shape the way how I see things, especially when it's coming to networking and network communication I guess how we are communicating with the Internet and the connections in the seven layers of communication or connection, 


Try Hack Me progress recording

# Packet-Analysis-Journey 
Learning to analyze network packets using Wireshark. Logs, notes, and progress.
# Wireshark Labs -

ive started this lab as part of my learing path way, it was approximately month since I started, at the 15-may-2025 ive completed the room wireshark

This repo tracks my learning progress with Wireshark.  
A month ago, network traffic looked like gibberish â€” now I can analyze TCP handshakes, DNS lookups, and spot suspicious activity.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark - vm on site 
- TryHackMe SOC 1 pathway
