# ðŸ§ª Wireshark Lab - TCP Handshake

## âœ… What I Did
- Followed the TryHackMe "Wireshark" lab
-
Those are examples of notes that I used to take on my notebook and later on in this documenting I will make the notes appear more neat so it will make more sense but right now this is what's work for me and that's what important

- Captured network traffic using Wireshark
- Focused on filtering TCP handshakes

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How a 3-way handshake works: SYN â†’ SYN/ACK â†’ ACK
- How to apply filters in Wireshark:
