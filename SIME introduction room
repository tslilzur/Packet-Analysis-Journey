SIME - Standard info and event management system at all that collect data from some end points and hardware devices across the Internet and store them
Each network component one or more create logs and store them - the source of logs

For example, it will be easy to divide to 2 sections : 

- host centric logs : 
User access a file
Users might attempt authentication

- network eccentric logs: 
SHH connection
Web traffic
User connecting to a VPN

Then why using? SIME - end points generate hundreds of blocks per seconds to try examine them one by one it will be impossible. SIME to help with that.
Every device in the network generate logs, whatever it's performed in action, in Windows any event can be viewed. Any event can get assigned with a special ID that make it easier to track.

In linux logs are stored than investigated with a steam tool 
Web server : it is important to keep eye on web traffic in and out (request and response) for any potential attack
It helps getting a better picture of what's going on on the network alarming if needed it is collecting the data examine it and let analysis know if something suspicious is coming
For example, monitoring false positives and examining network traffic for detection of anomalies or suspicious behaviours
All of these can be done with the help of the SIME tool
